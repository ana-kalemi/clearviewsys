It is very important to note that aliases NEVER appear on any picture IDs.&nbsp;</p><p>For example some names entered in the system were:&nbsp;</p><p>1) Abu ibraheem Al Almani&nbsp; (first name: Abu Ibrahim; last name: Al Almani)<br />2) Obeideh Alturki (first name: Obeideh; last name: Alturki)</p><p>In the first case, the&nbsp;&nbsp;person's real name is &quot;Yassin Chouka&quot;. The ID will never show &quot;Abu Ibraheem Al Almani&quot; meaning &quot;Abu Ibrahim The German&quot;. Al Almani is not a last name and &quot;Abu Ibraheem&quot; is not a first name. It's like checking &quot;Sunny Side Up&quot; for an Italian mafioso name, or Georgio Almani (George the German) as a subject first name and last name.&nbsp;The second alias means the &quot;The Turkish Al Ubayda&quot;. The full name should be entered as Mulfit Kar Iiyas Al Ubayda (First name: Mulfit Kar Iiyas, Last name: Al Ubayda).&nbsp;</p><p>These aliases are simply different nicknames that these individuals go by in their neighborhouds or by their peers. There are no official government issued ids with such nicknames printed on them.&nbsp;If you were a police investigator, you need all matches to aliases to be brought up, but when you are an MSB, you should not care about the aliases as these aliases NEVER EVER appear on picture IDs.&nbsp;</p><p>Both names will match positively on the OFAC SDN list when the names are entered according to the &quot;First name&quot; and &quot;last name&quot; as seen on their ID. Our systems scans the list from the XML file encoded list, which has the EXACT first name and last name fields.&nbsp;</p><p>We update our list at least once per day.&nbsp;</p><p>The pdf file available on OFAC is not very easy to read as it doesn't explicitly mention the first name and last name, but the XML encoded list does. The latter list is not easily readable by humans as it is intended to be read by a computer. Both list are available to download here:&nbsp;</p><p><u><font color="#0023E4">https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/t11sdn.pdf</font></u><br /><u><font color="#0023E4">https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdn.xml</font></u></p><p>CurrencyXchanger detects all the name with 100% accuracy as long as they are entered corrently in the system. </p></div></li><li>	<div class="lesson-title"><a href="lessons/500_EUR_bills_denomination.html">500 EUR bills denomination</a></div>	<div class="description"><p>In europe 500 euro notes are often used in money laundering, thus we are required to provide reporting on the use of any 500 euro notes for each transaction involving 500 Euro notes</p></div></li><li>	<div class="lesson-title"><a href="lessons/Transactions_Example.html">Transactions Example</a></div>	</li><li>	<div class="lesson-title"><a href="lessons/Accessing_the_Sanction_Lists_using_your_Web_Browser.html">Accessing the Sanction Lists using your Web Browser</a></div>	<div class="description"><p>CurrencyXchanger uses a webservice developed by Clear View Systems to check for entities and individuals that are listed on government sanctions lists such as: OFAC SDN, OSFI, AUSTRAC, and New Zealand's Police.

For such circumstances, you can create database field constraints.

                    environment. None of these goals would have been possible to achieve without the ongoing
                    support and training from Tiran and Houman, which resulted in an overwhelming task becoming
                    a smooth roll-out in the business. We are looking forward exploring the system further as it
                    has become a true asset to our business."

                    Houman is world class. CurrencyXchanger is one of the best purchase decisions we've made for
                    our business."

                    familiar with the different functions at first, but once they are learned and understood,
                    it became very easy to use. Functions are extremely user-friendly once you get to apply
                    them in a business environment. The system is also very flexible and can be adapted to any
                    type of currency exchange business. Before purchasing this product we examined various other
                    products on the market but none had the flexibility of this one. Also the friendly customer
                    support is a major plus"

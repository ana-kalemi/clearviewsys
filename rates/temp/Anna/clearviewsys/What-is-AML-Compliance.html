                        an increasing pressure on MSB and other financial companies to conform with new government
                        Anti-Money-Laundering AML regulations. AML Compliance is a short term for referring to
                        all systematic methodologies used to conform with these regulations.

                        If you are not aware, there has been an increasing trend about banks and other financial
                        institutions closing down accounts of MSB (Money Service Businesses). This phenomenon is
                        more prevalent in the US and Canada, but have been followed in other countries such as
                        Australia, UK, New Zealand, and so on.

                        This question may seem out of place, but we have been continuously receiving this
                        question for several years. If you are a new Money Service Business, you have to
                        stop and read this before you approach your bank. Remember that you only get one
                        chance to make it right, so you better prepare for this challenge ahead of time.
                        We certainly recommend that you talk to an AML expert before you approach your bank.
                        This short note will explain what you need to know ahead of time.

                    <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                        The general impression is that banks are trying to kill their competition by eliminating their
                        ability to bank. Although this may have aThis may seem like a valid incentive, but it is not
                        the real reason behind their decision. The reason comes down to risk-control and mitigation.
                        MSBs are inherently very risky clients for the banks, as they are easy targets for money
                        launderer and terrorist financers. The banks do not have the time and resources to make
                        sure all their clients are following the rules and regulations, so they try to mitigate
                        their risk by elliminating the cause. Having said that, we are not trying to imply that it
                        is impossible to open a bank account in any financial institution, but it is definitely
                        a big challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                        There are more than one factor or two that determine the risk score of an MSB. Banks
                        have to go through a very sophisticated and thorough process of risk-assessment to
                        evaluate the capacity of an MSB in terms of fighting money laundering and terrorist
                        financing. Basically, you have to make it easy for the banks to realize that you have
                        thought of their problem and approached them with a feasible solution.

                        You may be aware of the concept of a score-based risk evaluation. Perhaps
                        you know that when an individual applies for a loan, the creditor will
                        evaluate the risk based on different factors. One of these factors is
                        the credit score of the individual. This credit score is calculated and
                        evaluated over the years.

                        you Banks have different risk-assessment matrix but
                        they all share some common properties. These are some of the issues that could influence
                        the bank's decision one way or another:

                                Computerized Record Keeping System (the system that you are using must be compliant
                                with regulations). MSBs that are using manual record-keeping system will have a very
                                difficult time to keep their accounts operational.

                                Your management should be aware and trained on all the regulations for AML and ATF.
                                You should keep and provide evidence of your management training in regulatory
                                safeguards, record-keeping and reporting.

                                dealing precious metals, etc...); more services is usually riskier. As the bank
                                will have to report your MSB's transaction to your regulator, they want to know
                                how much reporting cost you will bring them.

                                (manual of AML and ATF custom-made for your business). Your compliance manual

                                with recurring clients. A generic compliance manual will not be acceptable by

                                manual systems. Your list must be updated at least on a weekly basis. Most Canadian
                                banks are partners with US banks and therefore, must comply to US banking regulations.
                                As a Canadian MSB who want to maintain your banking relationship, you must ensure to
                                check OFAC' SDN list as well as OSFI list. You also should let you bank know how you
                                achieve this.

                                You should be very well prepared to answer questions from the bank regarding your
                                compliance program.

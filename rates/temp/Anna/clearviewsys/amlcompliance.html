                The competitive world of foreign exchange business and new regulatory environment, have created an
                increasing pressure on MSB and exchange bureaus to conform to new government and banking regulations

                Tough banking regulations will affect your MSB business!
            </h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                If you are not aware of it, there has been an increasing trend about banks, credit unions and other
                financial institutions closing down the operating accounts of MSB (Money Service Businesses).
                This phenomenon is more prevalent in the US and Canada, but have been followed in other countries too.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                The general impression is that banks are trying to kill their competition by eliminating their
                ability to bank. This may seem like a valid incentive, but it is not the real reason behind
                their decision. The reason boils down to risk-management and control for their own AML
                compliance. MSBs are inherently risky clients in terms of being target of money launderer and
                terrorist financiers. However, there are more than one factor or two that determine the risk score
                of an MSB. Banks have to go through a very sophisticated a thorough process of risk-assessment to
                evaluate the capacity of an MSB in terms of fighting money laundering and terrorist financing.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                Some banks have a slightly different risk assessment matrix but they all share some common properties.
                These are some of the issues that could influence the bank's decision one way or another:
            </p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Computerized AML Compliant Record Keeping System (the system that you are using must be
                        compliant with regulations). MSBs that are using manual record-keeping system will have a
                        very difficult time to keep their accounts operational. It is only a matter of time before
                        the authorities will find you and put your business out of commission.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Number of branches that you have (the higher, the riskier). If you run a multi-branch
                        operation, you must have a way to consolidate the data between your branches and report
                        suspicious aestivates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your management should be aware and trained on all the regulations for AML and ATF. You
                        should keep and provide evidence of your management training in regulatory safeguards,
                        record-keeping and reporting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The variety of services that your MSB offers (remittance, cash, cheque cashing, dealing
                        precious metals, etc...); more services is usually riskier. As the bank will have to
                        report your MSB's transaction to your regulator, they want to know how much reporting
                        cost you will bring them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        AML (Anti-Money-Laundering) & ATF (Anti-Terrorist Financing) program in place (manual of
                        AML and ATF custom-made for your business). Your compliance manual should mention how you
                        will perform your KYC, KYA (Know Your Agent) , KYE (Know Your Employee) , 24-hr rule, sanction
                        list checks every time you deal with recurring clients. A generic compliance manual will not
                        be acceptable by the banks anymore.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Background checks against sanction lists: must be automated, they will not believe that
                        you will ever do this manually. Your list must be updated at least weekly.
                    </li>
                    <li>Reporting program. Please keep all records of your reporting.</li>
                    <li>
                        As an MSB, you are prone to having suspicious transactions. You must keep the evidence
                        and provide it to the bank.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interview: you will be interviewed and the branch manager will put their own recommendation.
                        Some interviews are unofficial and may be done over the phone. You should be very well
                        prepared to answer questions from the bank regarding your compliance program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Training program: you should have regular compliance training program for your staff.
                        Keep a record of all training and provide to the bank as proof of your training program
                        in action.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Internal Audit program: You must mention in your compliance manual that you have provisioned
                        an internal risk-assessment program
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        External Risk Audit: You may be required to do an external audit by auditors such as
                        Grant Thornton, KPMG, Ernst & Young, or other.

                of Terrorism Regulations (OSFI) as well as the OFAC' SDN list. If a match is found against any
                of the sanctioned lists, a dialog box will pop up to display the origin of the match. The system
                will automatically block the transaction until proper due diligence is complete by the teller or
                the person recording the transaction. The system will warn the user several times before the
                transaction can be completed.

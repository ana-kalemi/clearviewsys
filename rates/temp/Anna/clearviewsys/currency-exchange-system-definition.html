                        <p>
                            Not having proper record-keeping software can prove to be a common problem amongst MSB.
                            If your business is still managed with pen and paper or with an excel spreadsheet,
                            you don’t have proper automated system for your record-keeping in place which can
                            lead you to be fined in your next AML audit. Penalties for non-compliance can range
                            from $50 to $500,000. Recently, a money services business in Brampton, Ontario, was
                            issued a penalty of $52000, for committing eight non-compliance violations.

                        <p>
                            Another risk of not having proper automated systems in place, is the risk of losing your
                            bank accounts. You must have an AML program in place or you will lose your bank account
                            almost guaranteed. Losing your banking relationship can be one of your costliest mistakes.

                There are other systems and solutions on the market, but they are missing many components which forces
                users to have multiple systems and having to enter redundant data into each system (e.g. accounting,
                POS, wholesale, export and import into Excel, etc...). CurrencyXchanger has one of the highest
                rating of all products in its category on Capterra's website.

            <h2 class="light text-center margin-bottom-70">What is a Client/Server configuration?</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-25">
                If you wish to have more than one computer running the system at the same time, then you need a
                computer to host the database and share the data with the rest. This computer is referred to as
                'the server'. The server should be located in a safe area with restricted access. In the world
                of computer, such as setup is called a client/server configuration.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-25">
                The advantages of a client/server configuration is that all data are stored on a centralized server,
                where backup is done regularly and the computer is out of reach of normal users who may tamper with
                it. The client computers (sometimes referred to as workstations) do not carry any data with them
                and if the client computer get damaged, nothing will happen to the database since it resides on
                the server.

            <h2 class="light margin-bottom-70">Can we still buy the system if we don't have Internet access?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes. You can use the system without internet access. However, we do not recommend using a system
                that you business depends on it without having the capacity to request online support and
                troubleshooting.
            </p>
            <h2 class="light margin-bottom-70">How do you install the demo version?</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-25">We will install the system remotely using TeamViewer. We ask you to register your computer with our
                credentials. It takes about 30 minutes to install and test the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of support people will guide you step by step to install the TeamViewer program on your computer.
                After that, we ask for your permission to connect to your computer and will take control of
                it to download, install and configure the files.
            </p>
            <h2 class="light margin-bottom-70">Will Clear View System be able to access our data without permission?</h2>
            <p>
                No. We will never access your data without your presence or permission. We ask you to disable any
                remote access software when you don't need support from us. This is a measure to protect your data
                from unauthorized access.
            </p>
            <h2 class="light margin-bottom-70">How long does it take to install and deploy the system?</h2>
            <p>
                This may depend on the company and how much time and effort is spent by the staff to learn the system
                after the training and installation of the system. For an average firm with 1 server, 2 front desk
                and 1 back office system, it takes an average of two hours to deploy the system. For a standalone
                installation it will usually take about 45 mins to 1 hour to install and configure the system.
            </p>
            <h2 class="light margin-bottom-70">How do you deal with training and installation for overseas companies?</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-25">
                We will try to accommodate our customers by calling them and providing support during their
                local business hours. Most of our customers are overseas and international. We do have support.
            </p>
            <h2 class="light margin-bottom-70">Why are the banks closing Money Exchangers bank accounts?</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-25">
                The overal impression is that banks are trying to kill their competition by eliminating their ability
                to bank. This may seem like a valid incentive, but it is not the real reason behind their decision.
                The reason boils down to risk-control and management for AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance.
                MSBs are inherently risky clients for the bank as they are easy targets money launderer and terrorist
                financers.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-25">
                However, there are more than one factor or two that determine the risk score of an MSB. Banks have to go
                through a very sophisticated a thorough process of risk-assessment to evaluate the capacity of an
                MSB in terms of fighting money laundering and terrorist financing.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-25">
                Some banks have a slightly different risk assessment matrix but they all share some common properties.
                hese are some of the issues that could influence the bank's decision one way or another:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Computerized Record Keeping System (the system that you are using must be compliant with
                    regulations). MSBs that are using manual record-keeping system will have a very difficult time
                    to keep their accounts operational.
                </li>
                <li>Number of branches that you have (the higher, the riskier)</li>
                <li>
                    Your management should be aware and trained on all the regulations for AML and ATF. You
                    should keep and provide evidence of your management training in regulatory safeguards,
                    record-keeping and reporting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The variety of services that your MSB offers (remittance, cash, cheque cashing,
                    dealing precious metals, etc...); more services is usually riskier. As the bank will have to
                    report your MSB's transaction to your regulator, they want to know how much reporting cost
                    you will bring them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    AML (Anti-Money-Laundering) & ATF (Anti-Terrorist Financing) program in place
                    (manual of AML and ATF custom-made for your business). Your compliance manual
                    should mention how you will perform your KYC, KYA (Know Your Agent) , KYE
                    (Know Your Employee) , 24-hr rule, sanction list checks every time you deal with recurring
                    clients. A generic compliance manual will not be acceptable by the banks anymore.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Background checks against sanction lists: must be automated, banks will not accept manual systems.
                    Your list must be updated at least on a weekly basis. Most Canadian banks are partners with US
                    banks and therefore, must comply to US banking regulations. As a Canadian MSB who want to
                    maintain your banking relationship, you must ensure to check OFAC' SDN list as well as OSFI
                    list. You also should let you bank know how you achieve this.
                </li>
                <li>Reporting program. Please keep all records of your reporting.</li>
                <li>
                    As an MSB, you are prone to having suspicious transactions. You must keep the evidence and provide
                    it to the bank.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interview: you will be interviewed and the branch manager will put their own recommendation.
                    Some interviews are unofficial and may be done over the phone. You should be very well prepared
                    to answer questions from the bank regarding your compliance program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Training program: you should have regular compliance training program for your staff.
                    Keep a record of all training and provide to the bank as proof of your training program in action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Internal Audit program: You must mention in your compliance manual that you have provisioned
                    an internal risk-assessment program. Your internal audit should take place at least once a year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    External Risk Audit: You may be required to do an external audit by auditors such as Grant
                    Thornton, KPMG, Ernst & Young, or other AML auditors.

            <p class="margin-bottom-50">
                The competitive world of foreign exchange business and new regulatory environment, have created an
                increasing pressure on exchange bureaus to conform to new government and banking regulations to
                deploy automated record keeping software systems.

            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                In most countries, every Money Service Business (MSB) is usually required to register with a
                government authority that enforces local, federal, and even international Anti-Money-Laundering
                (AML) laws. In Canada, every money services business has to be registered with the Financial
                Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). In the US, every MSB should
                register with FINCEN.

            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) is an independent agency
                responsible for the collection, analysis, assessment and disclosure of information in order to assist
                in the detection, prevention and deterrence of money laundering and financing of terrorist activities
                in Canada and abroad.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-50">
                FINTRAC receives reports from financial institutions and intermediaries, analyzes and assesses the
                reported information, and disclose suspicions of money laundering or of terrorist financing activities
                to police authorities and others as permitted by the Act. FINTRAC will also disclose to CSIS information
                that is relevant to threat to the security of Canada.
            </p>
            <h2 class="light margin-bottom-50 text-center">Penalties for Non-Compliance</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-50" >
                The penalties for non-compliance include significant fines and jail terms.
                The penalties are outlined in Part 5 of the Act. Failure to comply can lead to criminal charges
                against the persons and entities subject to the Act. The following are some of the elements of the
                penalties:
            </p>
            <div class="some-features">
                <ul class="margin-bottom-0 padding-left-20">
                    <li>Failure to report suspicious transaction: conviction could lead to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $2,000,000</li>
                    <li>Failure to report large cash transaction: conviction could lead to a fine of up to $500,000 for first offence and $1,000,000 for subsequent offences.</li>
                    <li>Failure to retain records: conviction could lead to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $500,000.</li>

            <h2 class="light margin-bottom-50 text-center">FINTRAC is independent from RCMP AND CSIS</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                FINTRAC will receive large amounts of data on financial transactions from across the country.
                FINTRAC has a legislated mandate to ensure that personal financial information in its possession
                remains confidential. In order to fulfill that part of its mandate, FINTRAC must maintain an arm's
                length relationship with law enforcement and CSIS.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                FINTRAC will only disclose limited information to law enforcement, as set out in the Act, when there are
                reasonable grounds to suspect that the information would be relevant to the investigation or the
                prosecution of a money laundering offence or a terrorist financing offence.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-70">
                When there are reasonable ground to suspect that information relates to threats to the security of Canada,
                FINTRAC will disclose such information to CSIS. No additional information can be disclosed to law
                enforcement agencies or CSIS unless a production order is obtained.
            </p>

            <h2 class="light margin-bottom-50 text-center">What will happen when reports are sent to FINTRAC?</h2>

            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                The reports collected by FINTRAC will be analyzed for unusual patterns of transactions that resemble
                money laundering or terrorist financing activity. FINTRAC will match these preliminary analyses with
                information from law enforcement and other databases.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                When FINTRAC concludes that it has "reasonable grounds to suspect" that information in its possession
                "would be relevant to investigating or prosecuting a money laundering offence or a terrorist activity
                financing offence" it will provide designated information as defined in the Act and Regulations, to
                the appropriate police force.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
                When there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the information is relevant to threats to threats to
                the security of Canada, FINTRAC will disclose the information to CSIS.
